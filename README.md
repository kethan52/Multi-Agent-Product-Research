## ‚ú® About the Project

In today's fast-paced market, validating new product ideas quickly and efficiently is crucial for entrepreneurs and innovators. Traditional market research can be time-consuming and expensive. This project introduces an autonomous AI agent crew designed to streamline this process.

This Streamlit application allows users to input a product idea, and then a crew of specialized AI agents collaboratively performs a preliminary market analysis, providing insights into market trends, competitors, target audiences, and a strategic SWOT analysis.

## üåü Features

* **Product Idea Input:** Easy-to-use Streamlit interface for describing your product.
* **Market Trend Analysis:** Identify industry growth, drivers, and challenges.
* **Competitor Intelligence:** Discover and analyze key rivals and their strategies.
* **Target Audience Profiling:** Define ideal customer segments and their needs.
* **SWOT Analysis:** Comprehensive assessment of product strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
* **Strategic Recommendations:** Actionable advice for market entry and differentiation.
* **Comprehensive Report Generation:** Output a well-structured Markdown report for easy review.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Technical Overview)

This application is built on **CrewAI**, an orchestration framework for LLM-powered autonomous agents. It leverages **GPT-4o** model as the underlying large language model.

The core workflow involves a crew of six specialized AI agents working together:

1.  **Market Trend Analyst:** Researches and summarizes broad market conditions.
2.  **Competitor Intelligence Agent:** Scours for direct and indirect competitors, analyzing their offerings.
3.  **Target Audience Profiler:** Defines the potential customer base, their pain points, and needs.
4.  **SWOT Specialist:** Conducts a comprehensive SWOT analysis of the product idea, utilizing insights from previous agents.
5.  **Product Strategy Consultant:** Synthesizes all findings and generates actionable strategic recommendations.
6.  **Market Research Report Generator:** Compiles all the structured output into a cohesive, professional Markdown report.

The agents use a `web_search_tool` to gather information from the internet, simulating real-world research.
